# In the Beginning

I started my mechanical keyboard journey in 2016 with the **Logitech G610**, a full-size board with MX Reds.

Back then, I loved watching setup videos and [ran into this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NqTUsbQD7w). When I saw the **Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB)**, I wanted one ever since.  
Being a student, I couldn’t justify the price just yet.

My next keyboard was a Durgod Taurus K320 TKL with Browns. The (relatively) compact form factor was a nice change, but I still longed for the HHKB experience.

## Into the Rabbit Hole

When COVID hit, the keyboard hobby exploded. I would frequent r/MechanicalKeyboards and YouTube for keyboard content, and eventually picked up the **Keychron Q2** with Gateron Milky Yellows.  
[I even made a video about it back in 2022.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMmN9zrK9Fs)

I started experimenting with mods, lubing switches, and chasing the perfect *thock*.

## Endgame?

The trend was clear: **Full-size → TKL → 75% → 65% → 60%.**
The saying goes that endgame is a myth, and I was starting to see why.

When **Wooting** released the 60HE in 2023, I jumped on it and modded everything: HE switches, a Tofu60 case, lubed stabs, and a PBTFans WOB set. It was perfect for gaming, but the typing experience still left something to be desired.

Around the same time, I dove into Neovim and Tiling Window Managers and loved the idea of going keyboard-only. I finally bought the **HHKB Hybrid Type-S** and it was a game-changer. I ended up selling most of my old boards, keeping only the HHKB and Wooting 60HE.

## The Splittening

During my internship at Intact, I used to bring my HHKB to work. I loved it, but I always felt uneasy brining an expensive keyboard to the office.

After a quick search on r/ErgoSplitKeyboards, the **Corne (CRKBD)**, was what caught my eye. I saw some listings on AliExpress for budget prebuilts, and it arrived pretty quickly.

That started a whole new rabbit hole for me. I eventually picked up multiple Corne variants.

My current fave is the Corneish Zen.

I can honestly say that I have found my endgame (for now).

TL;DR: endgame isn't real, HHKB is the closest thing, split keyboards are pretty cool.
